            <h2>WEB BASED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT</h2>
            <p>Our SFA system is a robust web application designed to streamline sales processes and enhance efficiency. Leveraging the power of Blazor, weâ€™ve crafted an interactive client-side experience using C# and .NET. Hereâ€™s how it breaks down:
<h3>Front End:</h3>
Developed using the Blazor Framework, our user-friendly interface combines HTML, CSS, and C#.
Blazorâ€™s component-based architecture ensures reusability and modularity, allowing us to create intuitive UI components1.
The use of modern web standards, including WebAssembly, ensures optimal performance.
<h4>Back End:</h4>
Our server-side logic is built on C# and .NET API.
Weâ€™ve integrated PostgreSQL (Postgres) as our database management system for seamless data storage and retrieval.
By combining these technologies, weâ€™ve created a powerful SFA solution that empowers your sales team to work efficiently, manage leads, track opportunities, and close dealsâ€”all within a unified, responsive web environment.!</p>

<h3>Front End:</h3>
iâ€™ve developed the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The clean and intuitive design ensures ease of use for inventory management tasks.
Leveraging CSS, weâ€™ve styled the system to provide a professional and visually appealing experience.
<h4>Back End:</h4>
MY server-side logic is powered by SQL databases, specifically using the WAMP stack (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
The database-driven architecture ensures seamless data storage, retrieval, and real-time updates.
iâ€™ve implemented efficient queries to handle inventory transactions, stock adjustments, and reporting.
By combining these technologies, weâ€™ve created an efficient and reliable inventory system that empowers businesses to track stock levels, manage orders, and optimize supply chain operations. This project showcases our expertise in web development and database management!</p>
